How this presentation will pan-out ? 
1) Introduction: quick overview of the paper, and how i analize it 
2) Key concepts --> quick overlook of the key concepts, such as: ICD (obv..), Neural Networks, RNN, CNN, t
                    and text processing algorithms. 
3) ICD Coding Problem -> Overview + ICD Taxonomy and EHD (electronic health document). 
4) Model structure --> Problem definition and architecture of the system 
5) Neural networks --> Basic neural networks + design isses. 
6) Feature extraction --> spatial features, sequential features and issues related to coding. 
7) integrating external knowledge 
8) Brief overview of the public dataset
9) Prospects --> Transfer learning, zero-shot learning, benchmarks and time complexity 
10) conclusions.
